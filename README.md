# your-fashion-curator
Where your personal stylist meets your wardrobe. Right at the comfort of your house, privacy, aesthetic, and budget. 

Your Fashion Curator is a webapp that curates and suggests outfit combinations based on the user’s preference and existing wardrobe. 
Users can upload pictures of clothing they own and then select the aesthetic they are looking for/select the occasion they are styling for. 
The webapp will then provide outfit combinations befitting the user’s request. 

The outfit combinations provided can be shown in the form of an image with a simple model wearing it. 
The webapp can also suggest pieces of clothing that the user do not have but may go well with their current clothing pieces.
